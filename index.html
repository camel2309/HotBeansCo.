                                    <h5>The Hot Beans company was founded by Chole Steph with three other women called Camille Bee, Genris Buggati and Scottland Heart in 2007.  </h5>

                                    <div class="coding 23" style="height:200px;"><img src="brown coffee.jpeg"></div>
                                    <p>The reason there is a repated motif of coffee beans is because the founder actually took a liking in the colour and texture after exploring the ways that coffee was made to sell which takes hard work and so has similarities with coding and the patience it takes. Coffee beans also reflect the freshness it has,this mirrors how creative our employees truly are with any client and how the employees have a unique perspective ,This company thrives off of respect so teamwork is highly encourged to make the dream work and we believe that communication is key , another aspect that the company uses would be ambition so this company like to be ambitious to clients request to allow the clients full request to be fufilled and possibly better to what they have originally visioned.</p>
